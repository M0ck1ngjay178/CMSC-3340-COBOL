# COBOL_Assignments

## 📚 Overview
This repository contains COBOL assignments completed as part of the CMSC-3340 COBOL course at PennWest-California University. The coursework was based on the textbook **"COBOL from Micro to Mainframe."**

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository includes the following materials:

- 📄 COBOL source code files (.cbl)
- 📁 Sample input and output files
- 📝 Documentation and assignment instructions
- 🧪 Test scripts

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
To work with the code in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- **GnuCOBOL** - An open-source COBOL compiler
- **Rocket COBOL** or **OpenCobol** - Alternative COBOL compilers
- **MSYS2** - For compiling and running COBOL code in a UNIX-like environment on Windows
- **Visual Studio Code** - Recommended IDE with COBOL extensions

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COBOL_Assignments.git
   cd COBOL_Assignments
   ```
2. Install GnuCOBOL and configure the environment using MSYS2.
3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code and install the COBOL extension.

## ▶️ Running COBOL Programs
To compile and run a COBOL program using GnuCOBOL:

```bash
cobc -x program.cbl -o program.exe
./program.exe
```

You can also run the programs using **Rocket COBOL** or **OpenCobol** as alternatives.

## 📘 Course Topics Covered
The assignments cover various COBOL programming concepts, including:

- Basic COBOL syntax and structure
- File handling (Sequential, Indexed, Relative)
- Data division and record layout
- Control flow and iteration
- Subprograms and modular programming
- COBOL debugging techniques
